  <h2>What</h2>
  <p>
    This service was born of my desire to quit Netflix but without having to lose all that info on what I've watched and what I've rated. To that end, I started investigating the <%= link_to "Netflix API", "http://developer.netflix.com" %>. While the API doesn't have exactly what I wanted (e.g. fetch all my rated movies), it was able supply enough functionality for me to fetch ratings for all the movies I had rented/streamed. Good enough, I suppose. Since collecting that information from Netflix takes time, I created a web service which would spawn <code>delayed_jobs</code> to do the work.</p>
    <p> To get started with your own export, click the <em>Authorize</em> button above, fill in your Netflix credential (note: we use Netflix's OAuth API. See the next section for more details), and this service will be begin exporting your Netflix DVD and Instant rental queue data for you. Once all of the records have been exported, you'll be able to download the data as a blob of <code>json</code>.</p>

  <h2>Secure</h2>
  <p>Our service is never given your Netflix credentials. We are using the <%= link_to "Netflix OAuth API", "http://developer.netflix.com/docs/read/Security" %>, which means you are only authorizing this web app to make requests on your behalf.</p>
  <p>We do store a few pieces of Netflix OAuth data in your cookies, including your Netflix <code>user_id</code> so that you do not have to keep re-authorizing the web app if you want to use it more than once. When you are done using this service, you can click the <%= link_to "[sign out]", sign_out_path %> link in the toolbar and we'll flush that information from your cookies.</p>
  <p>Your exported rating information is stored in our database for short, indeterminate amount of time, after which it is permanently expunged during recurring, routine maintenance.</p>
  <p>This data is available to only you.</p>

  <h2>Good news, Bad news</h2>
  <p>The bad news is that this service is only using one web dyno and one worker process. So, it is going to be slow. The good news is, this service is free!</p>
  <p>Even more good news, the code for this service is available on <%= link_to "Github", "https://github.com/sorens/ratings-exporter" %>. Feel free to inspect it to ensure that we're not doing anything untoward with your data.</p>
  <p>Netflix does limit the number of requests to 5,000 per user per day. I figured this out after I had architected the service to make a single request per title to fetch your ratings. There is a way to request several ratings in a batch, but I haven't got back and retrofitted the service to do that yet. If you have more than 5,000 movies in your rental history, then it will take you a few days to export your entire history. If you hit the 5,000 limit, you can come back to this service tomorrow and there will be a <em>Continue</em> button which will allow you to continue processing your export where you left off. If you want to skip the remaining exports, you can click the <em>Ignore</em> button instead. At which point, you will be able to download your data.
    <p>Use of this service is at your own risk. The authors of this webservice can not promise that bad things won't happen, up to and including the universe collasping back on itself.</p>
